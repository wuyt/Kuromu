/// The dense reconstructed model is represented by triangle mesh, or simply denoted as mesh. Because mesh updates frequently, in order to ensure efficiency, the mesh of the whole reconstruction model is divided into many mesh blocks. A mesh block is composed of a cube about 1 meter long, with attributes such as vertices and indices.
///
/// BlockInfo is used to describe the content of a mesh block. (x, y, z) is the index of mesh block, the coordinates of a mesh block&#39;s origin in world coordinate system can be obtained by  multiplying (x, y, z) by the physical size of mesh block. You may filter the part you want to display in advance by the mesh block&#39;s world coordinates for the sake of saving rendering time.
