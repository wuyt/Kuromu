/// CameraDevice implements a camera device, which outputs `InputFrame`_ (including image, camera paramters, and timestamp). It is available on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.
/// After open, start/stop can be invoked to start or stop data collection. start/stop will not change previous set camera parameters.
/// When the component is not needed anymore, call close function to close it. It shall not be used after calling close.
/// CameraDevice outputs `InputFrame`_ from inputFrameSource. inputFrameSource shall be connected to `InputFrameSink`_ for use. Refer to `Overview &lt;Overview.html&gt;`__ .
/// bufferCapacity is the capacity of `InputFrame`_ buffer. If the count of `InputFrame`_ which has been output from the device and have not been released is more than this number, the device will not output new `InputFrame`_ , until previous `InputFrame`_ have been released. This may cause screen stuck. Refer to `Overview &lt;Overview.html&gt;`__ .
