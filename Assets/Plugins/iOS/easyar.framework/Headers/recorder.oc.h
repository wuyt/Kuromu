/// Due to the dependency to OpenGLES, every method in this class (except requestPermissions, including the destructor) has to be called in a single thread containing an OpenGLES context.
/// **Unity Only** If in Unity, Multi-threaded rendering is enabled, scripting thread and rendering thread will be two separate threads, which makes it impossible to call updateFrame in the rendering thread. For this reason, to use Recorder, Multi-threaded rendering option shall be disabled.
