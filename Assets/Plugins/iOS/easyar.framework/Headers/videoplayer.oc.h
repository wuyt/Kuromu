/// <summary>
/// VideoPlayer is the class for video playback.
/// EasyAR supports normal videos, transparent videos and streaming videos. The video content will be rendered into a texture passed into the player through setRenderTexture.
/// This class only supports OpenGLES2 texture.
/// Due to the dependency to OpenGLES, every method in this class (including the destructor) has to be called in a single thread containing an OpenGLES context.
/// Current version requires width and height being mutiples of 16.
///
/// Supported video file formats
/// Windows: Media Foundation-compatible formats, more can be supported via extra codecs. Please refer to `Supported Media Formats in Media Foundation &lt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/supported-media-formats-in-media-foundation&gt;`__ . DirectShow is not supported.
/// Mac: Not supported.
/// Android: System supported formats. Please refer to `Supported media formats &lt;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats&gt;`__ .
/// iOS: System supported formats. There is no reference in effect currently.
