/// ARKitCameraDevice implements a camera device based on ARKit, which outputs `InputFrame`_ (including image, camera parameters, timestamp, 6DOF location, and tracking status).
/// After creation, start/stop can be invoked to start or stop data collection.
/// When the component is not needed anymore, call close function to close it. It shall not be used after calling close.
/// ARKitCameraDevice outputs `InputFrame`_ from inputFrameSource. inputFrameSource shall be connected to `InputFrameSink`_ for use. Refer to `Overview &lt;Overview.html&gt;`__ .
/// bufferCapacity is the capacity of `InputFrame`_ buffer. If the count of `InputFrame`_ which has been output from the device and have not been released is more than this number, the device will not output new `InputFrame`_ , until previous `InputFrame`_ have been released. This may cause screen stuck. Refer to `Overview &lt;Overview.html&gt;`__ .
